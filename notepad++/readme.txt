If you have already made some user defined languages, make sure you merge or backup their .xml file instead of just replacing it.

This file belongs in either...
- the installation directory of notepad++
- C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++

To activate it, go in Language->NScripter (bottom of list)
If Japanese characters look funky in Notepad++, go in Encoding->Character sets->Japanese->Shift-JIS

Improvements would be good.
TODO:
- Make ` work like the comment lines, but instead highlight it a different colour.
	Otherwise keywords like "for" and "if" become blue even in what should be considered a literal character string. This bugs me.
