Moriya Marie

The 8th-ranked School Monster. Mesomeso-san.
This monster is rumored to live in the old school toilets.
You can try talking over the door, but you will never get a reply.

Becoming a monster, she has been released by her past conditions. Her life is a little more stable.
Instead of hunting, occasionally she has lunch with the rest of the classes.

Tea cakes mysteriously come out of nowhere with great skill.
