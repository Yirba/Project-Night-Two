The Tea Man

Not one of the eight School Monsters, but it is whispered that his power is second greatest.
At the right hand of the Principal, a powerful monster, also known as the Assistant Principal.
Amplifying the dreams of children with the power to escape from reality.

He can be seen as full of compassion, or appear to be full of cruelty.
Like Higanbana and the others, as a specter he hunts.

It is his hobby to see the proceedings of having a low grade of "Dreams for the Future".
