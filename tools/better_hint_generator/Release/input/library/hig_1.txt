Higanbana

The third-highest ranked school monster; The Dancing Higanbana.
It is said that at night, she sits as a dancing doll on a shelf in the Health Office.
Injured when a spell was cast upon her, she is a resident of the infirmary.

They call her brutal; even monsters are fearful of her.
[However, on cone branches,] we get a sense of her personality; that of an evil demon, and just what we are dealing with.

She has a daily routine of eating a bun, usually late at night while watching cartoons on the infirmary television.
