Violet

School Monster Society 7th Rank:Violet of Twilight.
When playing in the schoolyard until darkness falls, before she knows it, the girl has died out.
Those children are spirited away when this monster whispers.

Formerly, she was a type of household deity for tea ceremonies.
But due to modern society's insidiousness, she became a monster governing bullying.

She does not have a television, and is jealous of Higanbana who does.
