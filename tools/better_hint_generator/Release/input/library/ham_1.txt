Hameln

The musical Hameln calls himself a monster. [Eight seats at the school are not those of monsters.]
With the sound of castanets, they would have been turned into animals.
The whistle is good, but really, when he speaks words which blow, the instrument changes.
In the presence of Nori's comparatively good personality, he's a pleasant monster and has a pleasant personality

Clearly Hikaru had made a stand and received the same treatment.

He's a strikingly handsome man with his mask removed, but the mask is your favorite part.
