Sakurada Michiru

A girl that styles herself based on her own inspiration, which she fortunately has. That inspiration is, in mockery of magic and exorcism, the fact that women are sometimes revered in the occult.

In spite of hesitation which could have been cured long ago, she removes the eyepatch, probably revealing an evil eye.
She often dresses in the Gothic tastes of her parents. Anti-Rosa brand clothes are her favorite.

By meeting Mesomeso-san, her patterns of inspiration have accelerated.
