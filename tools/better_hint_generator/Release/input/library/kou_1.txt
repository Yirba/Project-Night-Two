The Principal

The top-ranked of the school monster society: The Principal.
He appears from past photos in the Principalâ€™s office and roams the campus.
Spiriting away students, they will disappear until the facts are exposed.

Showing calm dignity to those without fear is quite brutal.
Though now he is old, he once swallowed the entire school as a large monster.

He has a scary wife, so, probably for that reason he tries to pass time staying at school instead of returning home.
