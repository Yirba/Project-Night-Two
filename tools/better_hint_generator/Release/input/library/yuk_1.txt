Sakaki Yukari

A miserable girl subjected to much bullying at home. A lonely girl.
By doing the housework on behalf of her dead mother, she has become disproportionately strong for her age.

She has a complex greater than that of young men, and wears cute clothes.
She hates bullying, in spite of the mischievous men who often bite.

With such a seemingly good personality and shape, she is becoming increasingly popular amongst women.
