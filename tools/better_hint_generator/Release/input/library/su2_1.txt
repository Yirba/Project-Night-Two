Violet

A violet kimono-wearing figure. Her god-possessed object, a tea-serving doll, has a smaller body than her.
Children bullied and beat her body, distorting it.

By becoming a bullied child herself, she was able to produce a stunt of "mass-produced bullies".
The more she was bullied, the happier she became, and she was recently awakened to scary, unknown pleasures.

Higanabana is subjected to her game, wherein she hunts with her as her mutual rival.
