Sakunoshin

He's not strictly a School Monster, rather, the chief of the animal spirits all around us.
He looks like a fox, but is really a lion.

Although he is usually unfussy, he actually has a very timid personality.
When you do things, he will hear them. However, he is cursed and cannot hear at night.

His favorite foods are fish-paste cakes and pounded fish cakes among others. He receives them as offerings from the Health Teacher.
