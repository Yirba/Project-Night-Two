Memata Youko

A forest girl that longs for purity of heart. She was a cute girl that everyone loved.
Her friends, to protect her, unfortunately had to falsely accuse Nonomiya.

Thanks to the whims of Higanbana, she safely went to heaven, and now attends school there.
Occasionally, she seems to blend back in with the living classmates as a ghost.

Nonomiya was not aware, but she must really have liked him.
