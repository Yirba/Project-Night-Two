Nihei Hikaru

As a precocious boy, his immature classmates looked down upon him.
The grades from school were excellent from early. He continued in search of better and better ones.

He was bullied because of that, and, out of anger, hit a rabbit.
At best, she should have kept his temper and just chopped up an eraser.

His two patients were assigned to the kitchen. Inside his mind, he has a dark, lurking consciousness.
